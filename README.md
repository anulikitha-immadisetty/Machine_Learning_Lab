**Introduction**

The Machine Learning Lab is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience and practical skills in machine learning. 
Over the course of four months, learners have delved into essential Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, laying the groundwork for
advanced machine learning concepts.

**Topics Covered**

**1. Introduction to NumPy**

**2. Introduction to Pandas (Series and Dataframes)**

**Projects**

I am encouraged to apply knowledge through hands-on projects, reinforcing concepts learned throughout the lab. These projects cover real-world scenarios and 
problem-solving exercises.

**Acknowledgments**

I would like to express my gratitude to the mentor and the open-source community for their valuable contributions and support in creating
this learning experience.
