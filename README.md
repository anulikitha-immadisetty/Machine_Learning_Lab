Introduction

The Machine Learning Lab is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience and practical skills in machine learning. 
Over the course of four months, learners have delved into essential Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, laying the groundwork for
advanced machine learning concepts.

Curriculum Highlights (Month1-Month4)

1. Basic exercises on Python Machine Learning Packages such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib
2. Python exercise on Feature Engineering, Data Visualisation
3. Programs on Covariance, Correlation, Covariance Matrix and Correlation Matrix
4. Implement Linear Regression and calculate sum of residual error
5. Program to implement different distance functions
6. Program to implement decision tree learning
7. Program to implement K-nearest neighbour classifier
8. Program to implement Principle Component Analysis
9. Program to implement perceptron for different learning task
10. Programs to implement ADALINE and MADALINE for given learning task
11. Program to implement classification task using Support Vector Machine
12. Programs to implement different Clustering algorithms

Prerequisites

Before starting the Machine Learning Lab should have a basic understanding of:
Programming Skills:
Strong proficiency in Python, is essential.
Understanding of object-oriented programming principles can be beneficial.
Mathematics,Machine Learning Fundamentals,Data Handling,Data Splitting,Evaluation Metrics,Visualization,Machine Learning Libraries,Understanding Algorithms.

Topics Covered

1. Introduction to NumPy
2. Introduction to Pandas (Series and Dataframes)

Projects

Iam encouraged to apply knowledge through hands-on projects, reinforcing concepts learned throughout the lab. These projects cover real-world scenarios and 
problem-solving exercises.

Acknowledgments

I would like to express our gratitude to the mentor and the open-source community for their valuable contributions and support in creating
this learning experience.
