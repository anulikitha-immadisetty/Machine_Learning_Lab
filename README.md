**Introduction**

The Machine Learning Lab is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience and practical skills in machine learning. 
Over the course of four months, delved into essential Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, laying the groundwork for
advanced machine learning concepts.

**Topics Covered**

**1. Introduction to NumPy**

**2. Introduction to Pandas (Series and Dataframes)**

**3. Introduction to Matplotlib**

**4. (a)Handle the missing data with the appropriate techniques. 
     (b)Handle the categorical data by using one hot encoding.
     (c)Feature scaling techniques such as min-max normalization, standarization and z-score.
     (d)Creating a new feature representing the average tip percentage for each dining party size.
     (e)Creating a new feature based on total bill and tips if total bill is greater than 10$ and tips is greater.
     All these questions are solved by using tips.csv (dataset file)**
